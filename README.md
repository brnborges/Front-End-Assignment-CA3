# Project Summary

For this assignment, I built a semantic HTML5, CSS and JavaScript website with a responsive design. I have decided to make a page related to portfolio where in the future I can change the content. So, people can know my work. 
I saw throughout the module and research some tools that would directly facilitate my work, 
but I wanted to challenge myself to the maximum by creating the page from scratch.
This encouraged me to understand how each tool really works.
In my view this was a great challenge due to the fact that many external factors did not help during our lockdown like: restricted access to the internet, lack of privacy and concentration, things that directly interfere with any type of result, but in general I am happy with my effort and below I will try to explain some processes in some way.

## Development Process

### Starting Off - Initial Ideas

### Webpages, layout and structure

* Five webpages - Index (Home), Skills (My personal skills), About me (my description), Portfolio / Gallery (Some photos), Contact (contact me).
* Target Audience - people who want to contact me and  analyse my way of working
* Colours - I tried to use a colours pattern. A little dark with a strong presence of burgundy with a background image that matches these colours bringing a futuristic theme.
* Font - 'Syncopate', sans-serif in almost the entire site and 'Luckiest Guy', cursive in some specific points.
* Logo – This is found after the animated menu is opened.
* Consistent, user-friendly and accessible design.

### Coding the layout and structure

I created a starting point where I would create a template for all the pages and then I would replicate to other pages. My first action was to create the side bar and make this menu be responsive and lively because it was my challenge and my main idea was to bring an animation for my page. 
Then I had the idea to put my Logo to open together with the sidebar.
At first glance this was not seem like a very good idea because of the level of difficulty to do it, but it worked as I wanted, and I liked the result. 
I used JavaScript functions to be able to bring this animation from the menu correctly.

I decided to make a bar with icons that redirect straight to the respective social media, after a look at W3Schools, I found some tutorials that helped me a lot to understand it and I managed to run on my Index.

I posted a video also linked from YouTube for the users of the website understand the importance of great design and have a better understanding of the subject.
One of my biggest challenges dealing with the formatting of the pages was the issue of the footer, I had problems in several attempts to fix it at the end of the page, finally I managed to do it somehow and ended up not trying other ways.
To give an extra touch to the page I had the idea to put a Fly animated text on each page to describe itself and its uses. For the text to be animated I used a function and JavaScript again.

On the other pages I followed the same model and what is worth mentioning is a carousel of images that I brought to make the user more familiar with me and with some editions and photos that I took.

On the contact page I left a contact form and a map with the location of our school.

### Final touches

In the final phase of the project I tried to refactor the code as much as I could adding some other basic details like the address when clicking on each icon.
I was commenting my code to make it easy for other people read.
I did my best to make the page responsive for any type of user even if they access the website through tablet or mobile phone.

### Issues Faced / Solved

I had many difficulties in understanding some issues of positioning, pixel  in terms of the layout. I believe I could have programmed myself better and executed it in a more objective way.
About the code, I was analysing other models and I realized that I could have had good practices on several occasions, but I believe it is a great start and I will try harder to achieve better results
